# Overview

Sitecore interview project. 

A simple library that users can add/ edit/ delete authors and books. An author can have many books and a book can be written by many authors.

Note:
1/ the user must create an author before adding any book relates to that author.
2/ the app does not cover all the requirements in the project.

Enjoy!
